# Swipe & Flip Fixes

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Swipe Conflicting with Flip**
**Problem:** When trying to swipe, the card would flip instead. Drag and tap events were conflicting.

**Solution:**
- Added `isDragging` state to track when user is swiping
- Added `handleDragStart` to set `isDragging = true` when swipe begins
- Added delay in `handleDragEnd` to prevent tap from triggering after swipe
- Updated flip handler to only flip if `!isDragging`

```typescript
const [isDragging, setIsDragging] = useState(false);

const handleDragStart = () => {
  setIsDragging(true);
};

const handleDragEnd = (event, info) => {
  // ... handle swipe ...
  
  // Delay to prevent click after drag
  setTimeout(() => setIsDragging(false), 100);
};

const handleFlipCard = () => {
  // Don't flip if user is dragging
  if (!isDragging) {
    setIsFlipped(!isFlipped);
  }
};
```

### 2. **Back of Card Not Showing**
**Problem:** When flipping, the back side with description wasn't visible.

**Root Cause:** The transform was applied incorrectly. Both front and back were trying to transform independently instead of the container rotating.

**Solution:**
Applied proper 3D flip card technique:

1. **Container** - Rotates 180deg when flipped
```typescript
<div
  style={{
    transformStyle: 'preserve-3d',
    transform: `rotateY(${isFlipped ? 180 : 0}deg)`,
    transition: 'transform 0.6s',
  }}
>
```

2. **Front Side** - Starts at 0deg, backface hidden
```typescript
<div style={{ 
  backfaceVisibility: 'hidden',
  WebkitBackfaceVisibility: 'hidden',
}}>
```

3. **Back Side** - Starts at 180deg (facing backwards), backface hidden
```typescript
<div style={{
  backfaceVisibility: 'hidden',
  WebkitBackfaceVisibility: 'hidden',
  transform: 'rotateY(180deg)',
}}>
```

**How it works:**
- When flipped = false: Container at 0deg, front visible (0deg), back hidden (180deg facing away)
- When flipped = true: Container at 180deg, front hidden (0deg now facing away), back visible (180deg + 180deg = 360deg = 0deg facing forward)

## ✅ What Works Now

### Swiping:
1. User starts dragging → `isDragging = true`
2. User drags left/right → Visual feedback shows
3. User releases:
   - If > 100px right → Saves & moves to next post
   - If > 100px left → Passes & moves to next post
   - If < 100px → Card bounces back
4. After 100ms delay → `isDragging = false`

### Flipping:
1. User taps card → `handleFlipCard()` checks `!isDragging`
2. If not dragging → Flip animation runs (0.6s)
3. Back side shows with full description
4. User taps "← Back" button → Flips back to front
5. Can tap/flip as many times as needed

### No Conflicts:
- **Tap** (quick touch) → Flips card ✅
- **Swipe** (drag motion) → Navigates to next post ✅
- Swipe won't trigger flip ✅
- Tap after swipe won't trigger flip ✅

## 🎯 User Experience

**Correct Behavior:**

1. **To see details:** Tap anywhere on the card image
2. **To swipe:** Drag left or right with some force
3. **To go back:** Tap "← Back" button on back of card

**Visual Feedback:**

- Swiping left → Red "✕ PASS" badge appears
- Swiping right → Green "❤️ SAVE" badge appears
- Flipping → Smooth 3D rotation animation
- "Tap for details →" hint always visible on front

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Files Modified:
- `TripPostCard.tsx`

### State Added:
```typescript
const [isDragging, setIsDragging] = useState(false);
```

### Handlers Updated:
- `handleDragStart()` - New function
- `handleDragEnd()` - Added delay for isDragging
- `handleFlipCard()` - New function with drag check
- Flip buttons now use `handleFlipCard` instead of direct state update

### CSS Fixed:
- Container has `transformStyle: preserve-3d`
- Container rotates (not individual sides)
- Both sides use `backfaceVisibility: hidden`
- Front at 0deg, back at 180deg
- Added WebKit prefix for Safari compatibility

## 🎉 Result

The card now works perfectly:
- ✅ Swipe left/right to navigate
- ✅ Tap to flip and see description
- ✅ No conflicts between gestures
- ✅ Smooth animations
- ✅ Back side is fully visible with all details

**Status:** All fixed and working! 🚀
