## What the Backend Does

### The API Call (What Happens Behind the Scenes)

When you click "Find Hiking Trails", the frontend makes this API call:

```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/hiking-trip', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ 
    location: 'New York',
    radius: 50 
  })
})
```

This is the equivalent of the curl command:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/hiking-trip \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"location":"New York","radius":50}'
```

### The Response

The API returns:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "hikingTrips": [
    {
      "destination": "New York Mountain Trail",
      "location": "New York area",
      "distance": "15 miles",
      "difficulty": "Moderate",
      "description": "Beautiful trail with...",
      "trailInfo": {
        "length": "6 miles",
        "elevation": "1200 ft",
        "type": "Loop"
      }
    }
  ],
