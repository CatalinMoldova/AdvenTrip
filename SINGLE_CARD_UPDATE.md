- "‚Üê Back" button on back to flip again

### 4. **Progress Indicator**

- Updated as they swipe through

### 5. **End of Feed**
- When all posts are seen, shows completion screen

## üîß Technical Details

### SocialFeedScreen.tsx
```typescript
// Added currentIndex state
const [currentIndex, setCurrentIndex] = useState(0);

// Swipe handlers move to next post
if (currentIndex < personalizedPosts.length - 1) {
  setCurrentIndex(currentIndex + 1);
}

// Single card render
<TripPostCard
  post={personalizedPosts[currentIndex]}
  // ... props
/>
```

### TripPostCard.tsx
```typescript
// Fixed height for consistent flip animation
<motion.div
  style={{
    rotateY: isFlipped ? 180 : 0,
    transformStyle: 'preserve-3d',
    minHeight: '600px',
  }}
>
  {/* Front side with images */}
  <div style={{ backfaceVisibility: 'hidden' }}>
    {/* ... front content ... */}
  </div>
  
  {/* Back side with details */}
  <div style={{
    backfaceVisibility: 'hidden',
    transform: 'rotateY(180deg)',
  }}>
    {/* ... back content ... */}
  </div>
</motion.div>
