# 🚀 Complete Setup Guide - Authentication & Database

## ✅ What's Done

I've set up your app with:
- ✅ Clerk authentication (Google OAuth ready)
- ✅ Supabase database configuration
- ✅ Environment variables (.env.local created)
- ✅ Clerk provider wrapped around app
- ✅ Database schema ready to deploy

---

## 📋 Next Steps (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Run Database Schema

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard:
   ```
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qbtrpfhmowgkihinczsw/sql
   ```

2. Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar

3. Open the file: `database/schema.sql` in this project

4. Copy ALL the SQL code from that file

5. Paste it into the SQL Editor in Supabase

6. Click "Run" (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)

7. You should see: "Success. No rows returned"

✅ **Your database is now ready!**

---

### Step 2: Configure Clerk (Already Done!)

Your Clerk is already set up with:
- ✅ Google OAuth enabled
- ✅ Keys configured in .env.local

**To verify it's working:**
1. Make sure your dev server is running: `npm run dev`
2. Visit http://localhost:5173
3. You should see the landing page

---

### Step 3: Test Authentication

1. Restart your dev server to load new env variables:
   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to `/get-started` route

3. You should see Clerk's sign-in interface

4. Sign in with Google (or create test account)

5. After sign-in, you'll be redirected to the app!

---

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### Current Setup:

1. **Landing Page (`/`)** - Public, anyone can see
2. **Get Started (`/get-started`)** - Shows Clerk sign-in
3. **Home/Feed (`/home`)** - Protected, requires auth
4. **All other routes** - Protected, requires auth

### How It Works:

- Clerk handles all authentication automatically
- When user signs in → Clerk creates user session
- User info available via `useUser()` hook from Clerk
- Protected routes redirect to sign-in if not authenticated

```

## 🔄 What I'll Do Next

After you confirm the database schema is deployed, I'll:

1. ✅ Create API service for database operations
2. ✅ Replace mock data with real database calls
3. ✅ Sync Clerk users with Supabase users table
4. ✅ Update all components to use real data
5. ✅ Add image upload functionality
6. ✅ Set up real-time chat
7. ✅ Implement the recommendation algorithm with DB

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Missing Clerk Publishable Key" error
**Solution:** Restart dev server after creating .env.local:
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Issue: Database schema fails to run
**Solution:** Make sure you're in the SQL Editor of the correct project:
```
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qbtrpfhmowgkihinczsw/sql
```

### Issue: Can't see Clerk sign-in
**Solution:** Check that:
1. .env.local file exists with VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
2. Dev server was restarted after adding env file
3. You're on the `/get-started` route

---

## 🎯 Quick Commands

```bash
# Restart dev server (to load env vars)
npm run dev

# Check if env vars are loaded (should show your key)
echo $VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

# View logs if something fails
npm run dev --verbose
```

---

## ✅ Checklist

Complete these steps:

- [ ] Run database schema in Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Restart dev server
- [ ] Test sign-in at /get-started route
- [ ] Confirm you can sign in with Google
- [ ] Let me know it's working, and I'll integrate the database!

---

## 📞 Next Steps

**Once you've run the database schema and tested authentication, tell me:**

1. ✅ "Database schema deployed successfully"
2. ✅ "Authentication works"

**Then I'll:**
- Create all the API services
- Connect your app to the real database
- Migrate from mock data to live data
- Set up image uploads
- Enable real-time features

---

## 🔥 Important Notes

### Environment Variables (.env.local):
```
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_Z2l2aW5nLWFuZW1vbmUtNDguY2xlcmsuYWNjb3VudHMuZGV2JA
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://qbtrpfhmowgkihinczsw.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbG...
```

### Security:
- ✅ .env.local is gitignored (safe)
- ✅ Only public keys are in frontend
- ✅ Service role key commented out (use in backend only)
